update ERD - this is not a many to many relationship

made a successful axios call, now can i separate so that i make a call for an access token when i log in, store that as environment variables, and make other axios calls for endpoints wherever i want?

need a button to add an album to favorites

how to get css in ejs files again

maybe test out the access token storage in a controlled, separate environment
