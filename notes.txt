how display tracks? on the playlists page? do i need to send something additional to the playlists get route?

if i want pictures for tracks that's going to be an intense process of draggin along album JSON with me, figure out or drop column later

need to add ability to remove tracks to playlist edit page

at least tinker with materialize to make it look halfway ok

put in a 404 page with a link back to home page if there is an error

add ability to add a playlist at the screen where i choose a playlist to add a track to

EXTRA:
put some sound in there using Tone.js
try to incorporate both static and dynamic files
eventually get all these hefty spotify functions exported elsewhere to clean up code
issues with special characters in put/delete routes. do i need to encode them or something?
how do drop down menu? want to be able to select from several playlists
give ability to edit order of playlist
