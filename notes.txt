cannot have a question mark on the end of a playlist name or can't edit delete

eventually get all these hefty spotify functions exported elsewhere to clean up code

how do drop down menu? want to be able to select from several playlists

issues with special characters in put/delete routes. do i need to encode them or something?



TO ADD A TRACK TO A PLAYLIST I WILL NEED TO: 
have the add to playlist button take me to a page that has anchor tags with available playlists
somehow carry the song info with me
finally do the post request

if i want pictures for tracks that's going to be an intense process of draggin along album JSON with me, figure out or drop column later
