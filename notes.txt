update ERD - this is not a many to many relationship

made a successful axios call, now can i separate so that i make a call for an access token when i log in, store that as environment variables, and make other axios calls for endpoints wherever i want?

need a button to add an album to favorites

probably need to store the spotify Id for an album in the database for metadata api call

how to get css in ejs files again

maybe test out the access token storage in a controlled, separate environment

tried to set up a test only to learn that DOM manipulation and running code on a node server do not go hand in hand

eventually get all these hefty spotify functions exported elsewhere to clean up code

bring materialize in and see how that goes (can i just put in layout.ejs? do i need to bring into each .ejs file individually?)

can i add event listeners or materialize classes that allow me to mouse over an image and then have something happen to it like style change plus text appear (maybe this is extra, focus on basic styling/content first)
